### Raw data sources 
(1)	Princeton dataset:https://hydrology.soton.ac.uk/ <br> 
(2) HadEX3 dataset:https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadex3/download_etccdi.html <br> 
(3) Cropland data:https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/USGS_GFSAD1000_V1#bands <br> 

### 1. key codes <br> 
Sofware version: MatlabR2018b <br> 
1.data-preprocessing <br> 
The "data-preprocessing" folder contains two subfolders, "princeton_data" and "HadEx3_data." The code in each subfolder parses the original file data formats, extracts the data, and performs preprocessing. The processed data needed for subsequent calculations is saved in MAT format.

#### 2.Figures in Manuscript file <br> 
The manuscript contains a total of six figures. <br> 
In the manuscript file, Fig.1's calculation code is in the folder named "Figure1". <br> 
In the manuscript file, the calculation code for Fig.2 and Fig.3 is in the folder named "Figure2_3".  <br> 
In the manuscript file, Fig.4's calculation code is in the folder named "Figure4.   <br> 
In the manuscript file, Fig.5 and Fig.6 calculation code is in the folder named "Figure5_6".   <br> 

### 3.Figures in Supplementary information(SI) file  <br> 
In the SI file, Supplementary S1's calculation code is in the folder named "SI_1"  <br> 
In the SI file, the calculation code for Supplementary S2 and S3  is in the folder named "SI2_3"  <br> 
In the SI file, Supplementary S4's calculation code is in the folder named "SI4"  <br> 
In the SI file, the calculation code for Supplementary S5 and S6 is in the folder named "SI5_6"  <br> 
In the SI file, Supplementary S7's calculation code is in the folder named "SI7"  <br> 
In the SI file, Supplementary S8's calculation code is in the folder named "SI8"   <br> 
In the SI file, the calculation code for Supplementary S9 and S10 is in the folder named "SI9_10"  <br> 

Due to GitHub's file size limitations, we have compressed the calculation code and MAT data files into a single ZIP file. After downloading and unzipping the file, you can run the code directly.
